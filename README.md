# modvault

A Go CLI that replicates the functionality of saineju's [Modular Key Vault](https://github.com/saineju/modular_key_vault/tree/master).

## Building modvault

It seems that the Bitwarden Go SDK uses the Bitwarden Rust SDK which requires some hoop-jumping to build. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk-go/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
